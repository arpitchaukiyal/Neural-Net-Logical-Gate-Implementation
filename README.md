# Neural-Net-Logical-Gate-Implementation<br><br>
**Neural Network:**  An artificial neural network is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons that make up a human brain so that the computer will be able to learn things and make decisions in a humanlike manner. ANNs are created by programming regular computers to behave as though they are interconnected brain cells. <br> The output of a neuron is given by:<br>

**Activation Function:** Activation functions are decision making units of neural networks. They calculates net output of a neural node. It calculates a `"weighted sum”` of its input, adds a bias and then decides whether it should be `“fired” or not`.  

**Step Activation Function:** This is a threshold based activation function. If the value of Y is above a certain value, declare it activated otherwise it is not activated.<br>

**Sigmoid Activation Function:** A wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons.<br>

A logic gate is an elementary building block of a digital circuit.<br>
<u>For this project</u>, I have represented Logic Gates using the basics of Neural Network. I’ve created a perceptron that implements this Logic Gates. I have used different activation function like `Sigmoid Activation function`, `Step Activation function` etc. in our neuron. <br>
