# Neural-Net-Logical-Gate-Implementation
A logic gate is an elementary building block of a digital circuit.<br>
For this project, I have represented Logic Gates using the basics of Neural Network. Iâ€™ve created a perceptron using numpy that implements this Logic Gates. I have used different activation function like `Sigmoid Activation function`, `Step Activation function` etc. in our neuron. <br>
